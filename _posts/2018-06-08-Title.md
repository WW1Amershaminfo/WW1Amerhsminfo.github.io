    <td>In this case I had to make sure I really understood the question and then I had to think about about a suitable answer as the questions are getting progressively more difficult. I also needed to persevere which meant I completed last weeks target and also due to me not always getting the question right on the first time. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My learning was limited by how it took me a long time to answer the question and get it right and this was because I was not focused enough to achieve what I wanted to achieve.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>In the next lesson I am going to focus more when I am coding so I can answer the question better and try to get it right without having to try as many time as before. This will also enable me to get further and learn more about 'Python'. </td>
