    <td>For this lesson I had to think more than usual because I started to find this more challenging, which meant me having to answer and not always get it right because although I thought about it may not come to me. But after a few more goes I was able to work out what was wrong and where I needed to change it to get it correct.</td>

    <td>I felt like at some points I really was not sure what was correct after a few goes and that made my working rate rather slower than usual. I need to work on my skill of asking someone else as it will help me know how to answer the question.</td>

    <td>To improve I am going to ask for help if I feel like I need it. But I will make sure that I am not given the answer and I get a clue which will enable me to work it out myself and then I will remember for future lessons to come and years. </td>
