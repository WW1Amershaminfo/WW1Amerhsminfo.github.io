    <td>In Pyglatin, I found this section quite difficult to understand and therefore needed to ask my partner for some sort of clue which would lead my in the right direction. Once I had the clue I was able to figure out where I had gone wrong as well as understanding how to answer the question. This section also needed very precise answers, meaning there was only one correct way of solving the code as well as having to insert a reasonable amount of Python to allow the pyglatin to be correct.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My learning was limited by how I did not reflect on my learning and see what types of learning were effective and what else I could do to do better. This affected me because during the lesson I did not know what was limiting me educationally and therefore could not take in to account. If I was able to then I would have learnt more and reached more difficult.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>For next lesson I am going to review the strategies used, not now in my blog, but during the lesson. This will enable me to use the learning skills that I need to, to achieve more and work faster. I will also be able to think about what has inhabited my learning and prevent them from be used again. This will improve my learning in IT and the understanding I have of  the subject.</td>
