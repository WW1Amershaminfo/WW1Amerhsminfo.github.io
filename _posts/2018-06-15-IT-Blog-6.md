    <td>During this lesson I really felt that focusing allowed me to get through a significant number of questions as I was able to exceed section 5. This would also allow me to understand better what was happening as I was focusing a lot better at the task, compared to the last few weeks. I also felt that I was understanding, in better detail, what was happening and how to do it if I got another question on it.  This lesson went particularly well and I am pleased with how it went.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>This week my learning was limited by not always asking for help if I had tried multiple times but could not understand what was the correct solution. This meant that I would be on  a question longer than I wanted to because I thought I could complete it  by myself, but in actual reality, I just needed a clue to work with. If I had done this I could have got much further.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>For the next lesson I will assure myself that I ask a question to my teacher or someone working next tom if I am not sure how to get the answer. This will benefit me because I am to get further in my work and learn more from Python. The most important part, though, is that I ask to whoever is helping me what I have done to try and get the correct answer and just ask for a tip to guide me the right way so have been able to learn how to the type of coding..</td>
