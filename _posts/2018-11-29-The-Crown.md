The Crown is a modern 4* coaching inn. It provides food and is made of timber framed buildings. Also gatherings and lodgings can be held there with drinks. It is easily accessible with 45 bedrooms, a welcoming bar and a private room for weddings or parties. 

According to the National Heritage List for England, the Crown dates back to the 16th century. It had a family who belonged to James Child, who lived there in the 18th century. The family lived there for many generations until WW1 when it was turned into a hotel. The exterior of the building was refurbished in the 19th century.
