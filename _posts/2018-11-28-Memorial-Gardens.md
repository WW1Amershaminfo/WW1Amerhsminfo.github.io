It is the 100th year anniversary of the memorial gardens. The central water feature is surrounded by landscaped grounds. There is a wall-mounted memorial tablet commemorating the dead of World War 2. It was developed mid 20th century. The World War I memorial is a Portland stone cross fleury crucifix, with fleur-de-lys style crockets around the arms of the cross. In 2006, English Heritage and the Wolfson Foundation donated Â£1875 to the memorial, in order to put up the, WW2 and WW1 plaques.
