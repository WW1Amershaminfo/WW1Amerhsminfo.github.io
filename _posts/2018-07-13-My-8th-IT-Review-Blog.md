(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>Yes, and I completed Python Lists and Dictionaries.

  <tr>
    <td>During the course of the lesson I was able to learn lots from concentrating on the work, which enabled me to get more done as I completed two lessons. Also, I asked questions when the coding was particularly difficult, for me, which allowed to get further through and make sure I understood what was happening.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>This lesson, my learning was limited by the fact that I was not persevering as much as I would have liked, because although asking questions is ok, I want to have tried more on my own first. Persevering more would make me think more about how I should answer the question and use the information given.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>For next time I am going to try and persevere more to make sure I understand more and feel that I have solved the problem myself so I can be confident with myself. Also, if I am stuck, I could also use the clue which gives me a hint to be able to answer the question, but have still done it myself.</td>
