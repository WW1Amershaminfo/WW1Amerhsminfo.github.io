    <td>In this lesson I found the coding quite difficult to understand as there was a lot you needed to do, but understand to know how to answer the question. I found this lesson meant I needed to repetitively read the information to try and apply what they had done in to my own work. In these sections I did find myself asking quite a few questions to help me understand what I needed to do.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>In this lesson I felt that I had stopped trying to work out the answer after not having the solution. This ment I would ask someone a question to lead me the correct way, and if this didn't work I would maybe ask for the solution if I wasnâ€™t sure and try to see where I was going wrong.</td>

    <td>Next time, I wish to improve my learning by perivering if I am not sure. This is because I felt like I had stopped to soon and should have carried on figuring out how I should do it. Asking questions is fine, but I felt that mine were to soon and I should tried more myself first. Persevering will allow to work harder and understand what is happening because I have answered it on my own. </td>
