(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>

    <td>Over the course of this lesson, I found that these questions required a reasonable amount of reading over to try and understand what was happening. This was because the code was significantly more difficult than before and therefore required more time. During this lesson I felt that I worked well independently, not needing to ask a huge number of questions.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>In this lesson, my learning was limited by me not always trying really hard to work the answer out, but instead by using the hint to help me answer the question. I am able to use the hint, though I feel that it was used to early and used at a later stage, once I really have tried to figure out the answer to the question.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>For IT next year, I would like to make sure that I tried the hardest I can to answer the question, before I use a hint. This is to allow me to understand and the answer the questions use my own knowledge because otherwise, I will not have used my learning to answer the question and then I may not remember it afterwards when I do need it.</td>
